## UX - User Experience

### Design Inspiration

My inspiration for designing this book review project stems from my deep love of books. I aimed to create a clean and 
uncluttered interface, with clear, crisp forms and reader-friendly fonts, to ensure an enjoyable and seamless experience for all book lovers.

### Colour Scheme
<!--
 In line with the healthcare theme, I chose a neutral, clean palette:
 - **Primary Color:** #17A2B8 (Navy Blue-Grey)
 - **Secondary Color:** #132B67 (Hospital Blue)
 - **Accent Color:** #333 (grey)
 - **Background:** #fff (White)
 This combination ensures clarity, accessibility, and a professional appearance, allowing for easy navigation throughout the site.
-->
### Font
<!--
- For the logo and headers, I will be using **Lora**.
- The rest of the body text and interactive elements will use **Catamaran** for its readability and clean look.
-->

<!--
### **Bugs**
- ### Bug Fix #1: `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` Setting Causing Heroku Deployment Failure

**Issue:**  
During the deployment to Heroku, the following error occurred:

The error was caused by the absence of proper static file handling and a misconfiguration in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `settings.py`.

**Cause:**  
- The `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1` config variable was used in Heroku to prevent collectstatic from running during the initial setup.
- There was a duplicate entry for `django.contrib.staticfiles` in `INSTALLED_APPS`, which caused an error when trying to collect static files.

**Steps Taken to Fix:**
1. Fixed the duplicate `django.contrib.staticfiles` entry in `INSTALLED_APPS`.
2. Ensured the static and media handling was properly set up with Cloudinary and Whitenoise.
3. Deleted the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1` from Heroku's Config Vars.
4. Deployed again, which successfully collected static files and completed the deployment.


### Bug Fix #2: Permission Issues with Dashboard Access

**Issue**

Users are unable to access the Admin, Patient, and Specialist dashboards even though they are assigned to the correct user groups in the Django admin panel. The application either throws a 403 Forbidden error or does not recognize the users' group memberships.

**Cause**

The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of group membership checks in the views or misconfiguration of user group assignments within the Django admin panel.

### Steps Taken to Fix

1. **Investigate Group Check Functions**:
   - Reviewed the group-check functions (`is_admin`, `is_patient`, `is_specialist`) in `views.py` to ensure they correctly identify user groups.
   - Confirmed that the group names match those set in the Django admin.

2. **Validate Group Assignments**:
   - Ensured that users are properly assigned to the correct groups (Admin, Patient, Specialist) in the Django Admin panel.
   - Verified that the group names in the code match the group names set up in Django admin.

3. **Testing**:
   - Tested access with both existing and newly created users to ensure they can access their respective dashboards without issues.
   - Verified that group membership was properly recognized for all users.

4. **Revert Changes**:
   - Once the issue was resolved, reverted any temporary modifications to the views back to their original implementation.

5. **Verify Access Control**:
   - Tested edge cases, such as users without group assignments attempting to access dashboards, to ensure proper behavior.
   - Confirmed that custom `PermissionDenied` logic displayed the correct 403 error page for unauthorized access attempts.

**Outcome**

The problem was successfully resolved, allowing users to access their respective dashboards based on group membership without encountering 403 errors or redirection issues.

### Bug Fix #3: Form Not Visible on Homepage Due to Conflicting View Usage

### Issue
The form on the homepage not visible due to conflicting view usage. The homepage should display a form that allows users to search for specialists, but the form did not appear as expected.

### Cause
The conflict arises from the use of both a class-based `HomePage` view and a function-based `home` view. The class-based view does not properly pass the `specialties` context required to render the form on the homepage.

### Steps Taken to Fix

1. **Update URLs**:
   - Updated `core/urls.py` to replace the class-based `HomePage` view with the function-based `home` view to ensure the correct context is passed.

2. **Verify Context Passing**:
   - Verified that the `specialties` context was properly passed to `index.html` so that the form could display the list of specialties dynamically.

3. **Test Form Visibility and Functionality**:
   - Tested the homepage to ensure that the form was visible and correctly populated with the list of specialties from the database.

4. **Commit Changes**:
   - Added and committed the changes after confirming that the issue was resolved.

### Outcome
The form is now visible on the homepage and correctly displays the list of specialties, allowing users to search for specialists as intended. The conflict between the views was resolved by using the appropriate function-based view that properly passes the necessary context.


### Bug Fix #4: Signal Not Triggering on User Registration

### Issue
A Django signal intended to automatically assign new users to the "Patients" group and create a `PatientProfile` upon registration was not firing. This led to no profile being created and no group being assigned after user registration.

### Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect configuration of the `AccountsConfig` class in `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py` and missing signal imports in the `ready()` method of `accounts/apps.py`.

### Steps Taken to Fix

1. **Correct Configuration in INSTALLED_APPS**:
   - Updated `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py` to reference `'accounts.apps.AccountsConfig'` instead of just `'accounts'`. This ensured that the custom AppConfig class was properly loaded.

2. **Add Signal Imports in `ready()` Method**:
   - Added a `ready()` method in `accounts/apps.py` to correctly import the signal handlers, ensuring they were registered when the app was loaded.

3. **Remove Debug Statements**:
   - Removed unnecessary print statements that were used for debugging to keep the code clean and efficient.

### Outcome
The signal is now correctly triggered upon user registration, resulting in the automatic assignment of new users to the "Patients" group and the creation of a `PatientProfile` as intended. The configuration in `INSTALLED_APPS` and signal registration were successfully fixed.


### Bug Fix #5: Specialist Availability Submission and Display Issues

### Issue
Specialists encountered multiple issues when trying to set their availability. Initially, a 405 Method Not Allowed error occurred upon form submission. After fixing that, the start time was not displayed on the specialist dashboard, while the end time appeared correctly.

### Cause
1. **405 Method Not Allowed**:
   - The `post` method was missing from the `SpecialistDashboardView` class in `dashboard/views.py`, resulting in the 405 error when attempting to submit availability.

2. **Missing Start Time**:
   - The `start_time` was not displayed on the specialist dashboard due to a missing template tag (`{{ availability.start_time }}`) in the "Your Availability" section.

### Steps Taken to Fix

1. **Handle POST Method in View**:
   - Added a `post` method to `SpecialistDashboardView` in `dashboard/views.py` to properly handle form submissions, resolving the 405 Method Not Allowed error.

2. **Fix Start Time Rendering in Template**:
   - Updated the specialist dashboard template to include the `{{ availability.start_time }}` tag, ensuring that both the `start_time` and `end_time` are displayed in the "Your Availability" section.

### Outcome
Specialists can now successfully submit their availability without encountering the 405 error. Both `start_time` and `end_time` are displayed correctly on the specialist dashboard, providing a complete view of their available times for appointments.


### Bug Fix #6: Incorrect Template Rendered for Specialist Search Results

### Issue
The incorrect template was being rendered for specialist search results on the HealMate platform. A secondary `search_results.html` template in a different directory was causing confusion, leading to a simplified search results page being displayed. Key features like specialist bio, profile image, and pagination were missing.

### Cause
An additional `search_results.html` template was located inside the global `/templates/specialists/` directory. This template had minimal content and was unintentionally overriding the correct `search_results.html` template in the `/specialists/templates/specialists/` directory.

### Steps Taken to Fix

1. **Isolate Problematic Template**:
   - Renamed the global `/templates/specialists/` directory to determine if it was the source of the issue.

2. **Confirm and Resolve Issue**:
   - After confirming the issue was caused by the additional template, deleted the `/templates/specialists/` directory and its contents.

3. **Verify Correct Template Rendering**:
   - Verified that the correct `search_results.html` template inside `/specialists/templates/specialists/` is now rendering, displaying all necessary features, including the specialist bio, profile image, and pagination.

### Outcome
The correct template for specialist search results is now rendering as intended. The page displays all relevant information, including specialist bio, profile images, and pagination, providing users with a complete view of search results.

## Deployment

All code for this project was written in Gitpod as the integrated development environment. GitHub was used for version control, and the application was deployed to Heroku from GitHub.

### Pre-Deployment

To ensure a successful deployment to Heroku, the following practices are to be followed (Experience from previous Django projects):

- **Requirements File:** The `requirements.txt` file must be kept up to date to ensure all imported Python modules are configured correctly for Heroku.
- **Procfile:** A `Procfile` was added to configure the application as a Gunicorn web app on Heroku.
- **Allowed Hosts:** In `settings.py`, the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list was configured to include the Heroku app name and `localhost`. Example format:
    ```python
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-app-name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
    ```
- **Environment Variables:** All sensitive data such as the `DATABASE_URL`, `CLOUDINARY_URL`, and `SECRET_KEY` were added to the `.env` file, which is ignored by Git using `.gitignore`. These variables are added to Heroku manually through the Config Vars section.
